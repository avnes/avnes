## Audun V. Nes

### Professional life
I automate manual tasks in order to improve productivity and predictability for my colleagues and myself, so that we together can deliver value better and faster. This includes CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC) and maintenance or workflow scripts.

I'm using several programming and scripting languages to optimize my work when applicable. These languages and tools include Ansible, Jinja2, Python, Groovy, Terraform, Bash shell scripting and SQL.

I am also a strong believer in everything as code, and in my spare time I contribute to Open Source when time permits it. I also enjoy writing technical articles on my blog, or present content at meetups or to colleagues. Furthermore I regularly spend time on self study to learn new technical skills or improve existing ones.

### Personal life
Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and two daughters. During the summer I enjoy hiking in the forest.
