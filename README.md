### Professional life
I automate manual tasks in order to improve productivity and predictability for my colleagues and myself, so that we together can deliver value better and faster. This includes CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), GitOps and maintenance or workflow scripts. Most of time is spent on AWS Cloud and Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS), and its surrounding ecosystem of cloud native tools.

I'm using several programming-, scripting- and declaritive languages to optimize my work when applicable. These languages and tools currently include Terraform, Terragrunt, Flux CD, Python, Bash shell scripting, YAML and SQL. I've also started to learn Go programming. Previously I also used Ansible, Jinja2, and Groovy.

I am also a strong believer in everything as code, and in my spare time I contribute to Open Source when time permits it. I also enjoy writing technical articles on my blog, or present content at meetups or to colleagues. Furthermore I regularly spend time on self study to learn new technical skills or improve existing ones.

### Personal life
Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife and two daughters. During the summer I enjoy hiking in the forest.
